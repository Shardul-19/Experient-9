# Experient-9
AIM:

To study NumPy library in Python and perform operations such as array creation, checking dimensions, shape, datatype, and using built-in NumPy functions.


THEORY
____

NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical computations and array processing.

np.array(): Used to create 1D and 2D arrays.

ndim: Returns the number of dimensions of an array.

shape: Returns the size of each dimension in the form of tuple.

dtype: Returns the datatype of array elements.

np.zeros(): Creates an array filled with zeros.

np.ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.

np.arange(): Generates evenly spaced values within a given range.

np.linspace(): Generates evenly spaced numbers between a start and stop value.

Array Arithmetic: NumPy allows element-wise operations like addition and multiplication.

Statistical Functions: Functions like mean(), sum(), median(), and max() are used for data analysis.

CONCLUSION

In this experiment, we studied the NumPy library and its importance in numerical computation. We created one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays and explored their properties like dimension, shape, and datatype. We also performed arithmetic and statistical operations efficiently using built-in functions. NumPy simplifies mathematical and array-based operations in Python.
